# Davis Rig Data Processing Scripts
This repository contains a collection of R scripts designed to process behavioral data files generated by the Davis Rig apparatus, typically stored as .txt files. Each script reads the content of the files, extracts relevant metadata, and processes the main data section to compute summary statistics for behavioral experiments.

## Scripts
### TrialsPerStim
*Description:* This function processes behavioral data to count the number of trials for each unique concentration-stimulus combination where the number of licks is greater than zero. It also calculates the total number of uninitiated trials (trials with zero licks) up to the last initiated trial.
*Usage:* Use this function to determine how many trials were actually initiated by the subject in response to each concentration-stimulus combination.
### AverageLicksPerStim
*Description:* This function processes the data to calculate the average number of licks for each unique concentration-stimulus combination.
*Usage:* Use this function to analyze the average response strength to each concentration-stimulus pair, providing insight into the animal's preference or aversion.
### SumLicksPerStim
*Description:* This function calculates the total sum of licks for each concentration-stimulus combination. It is useful for determining the overall licking behavior of the animal in response to different stimuli.
*Usage:* Use this function to obtain the cumulative licking response for each stimulus, which can be a measure of the animalâ€™s total intake or preference over the course of the experiment.
## Hardware
Davis Rig Apparatus: The scripts are designed to work with data generated by the Davis Rig (Med-Associates; MED-DAV-160M), a system commonly used for behavioral experiments involving fluid consumption.
*Usage:*
Ensure that your .txt data files from the Davis Rig apparatus are available.
Use the appropriate function depending on whether you need to count trials, calculate averages, or sum licks per stimulus.
The results will be saved as data frames in the global environment, allowing for further analysis or export.
*Analysis and Output:*
Each function returns a data frame containing:
- Animal ID
- Experiment date
- The number of initiated trials
- The count, average, or sum of licks for each concentration-stimulus combination
- The number of uninitiated trials (for TrialsPerStim)
